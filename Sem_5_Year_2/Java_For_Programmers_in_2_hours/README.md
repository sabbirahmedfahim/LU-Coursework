## ✅ Fixed Syntax

In Java, **everything must be inside a class**.  
> 💡 The class name **does not need to match** the file name unless the class is declared as `public`.

```java
class AnyClassNameYouWant {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // System.out.println("Bismillah\n");
    }
}
```

## Operators, Conditional Statements & Iterators
- add two numbers (i know)
- divide, remainder is same as c++
- &&, || is same as c++
- if-else same as c++
- Indentation doesn’t matter to the compiler — but use it to make your code pretty
- do-while, while, for-loop is similar with c++ syntax
