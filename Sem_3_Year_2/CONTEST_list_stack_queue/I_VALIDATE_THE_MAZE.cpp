This is a very straight forward problem. I have to traverse the graph to check whether 
a maze is valid or not and if it has has exactly one entry point and exactly one exit point
or not. The problem is, I do not find any idea to use linked-list, stack, queue to solve the 
problem. I can use dfs or bfs here. Since it is restricted to use anything out of topic I am
stopped here.
